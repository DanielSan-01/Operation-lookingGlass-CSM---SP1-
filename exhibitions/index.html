              <h3>Cosmology</h3>
              <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,
                ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see
                and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
                about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab
                traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of
                the planets in our solar system.

              <h3>Evolution</h3>
              <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with
                the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did
                we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we
                have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place
                in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and
                how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
                also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t
                survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number
                of dinosaurs too.

              <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders
                of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
                longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
                growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of
                exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at
                some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin
                and the first heart transplant. Many of our great medicinal
                discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have
                beat us to it.

              <p>
                The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
                intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
                applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
                here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the

              <h3>Ecology</h3>
              <p>
                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
                planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore
                how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                the whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we
                unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
                extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the
                positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
